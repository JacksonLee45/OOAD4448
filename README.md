# Project One
Repository for Project 1 for CSCI 4448 (Object Oriented Analysis and Design).

### Teammates: 
- No one else, my original teammate dropped out of the semester. The Professor is aware.

### Issues Encountered:
- This was my first time working in Java so it took some time initially to get used to the syntax.
- Couldn't get the program to write to the txt file. Couldn't properly find where my output file was located within IntelliJ. Instead I copied the output from the console and pasted it into the text file.
